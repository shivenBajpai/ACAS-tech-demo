# Advanced Character Animation System

![In Development](https://img.shields.io/badge/Project%20Status-In%20Development-DE8410?style=plastic)

**ACAS is a proof-of-concept/practice project built in rust to attempt building a fluid and dynamic character animation system suited for 2D games, from scratch using no pre-existing game engine technology**<br>

This repository contains both the underlying animation tech as well as a demo project that showcases said tech

<hr>

> **Note**:
> The demo project uses SDL2 for cross-platform rendering and IO
> But the tech itself is not dependent on sdl2 in any way

### Build Instructions:

Building this project requires you to have the sdl2 developmental libraries installed
for more instructions refer to the readme on the official repo of the rust sdl2 crate: https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2
